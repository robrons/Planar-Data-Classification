# Planar-Data-Classification
A 2-class classification neural networks
ranging from 3 to 50 hidden layers to correctly classify points
according to their colors and to understand depth versus
accuracy of deep neural networks.
### Purpose
* Implement a neural network to classify a 2-Class data set, RED (Y=0) and BLUE (Y=1) points. 
* Compute the loss by minimizing the cross entropy. 
* Compute the accuracy for hidden units of sizes ranging from 1 - 50. 
### Implementation
*
